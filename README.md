# push_swap - A sorting algorithm using two stacks and limited operations.

__Push Swap was the first project implementing algorithms using C at Codam. 
The following is a description of the program:__

 </br>
<em>Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.</em>

## Installation:

```
git clone https://github.com/tmeulenb/push_swap; cd push_swap; make
```

## Usage:
```
ARG=`ruby -e "puts (1..50).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"``; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker -vcat $ARG
```

## Rules
```
The operations we were allowed to use:

sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.
```
</br>

## Expected result
```
The program should be able to sort:
* 3 integers in a maximum of 3 commands.
* 5 integers in a maximum of 12 commands. 
* 100 integers in a maximum of 700 commands. 
* 500 integers in a maximum of 5500 commands.
```


## My result
```
My program had the following amount of commands on average:
* 3 integers in 2 commands on average.
* 5 integers in 9 commands on average.
* 100 integers in 650 commands on average.
* 500 integers in 4950 commands on average.
```

<em>I enjoyed working on this project and liked the challenge to modify an algoritm to work using the limited operations.</em>
