# push_swap - A sorting algorithm using two stacks and limited operations.

Push Swap was the first project implementing algorithms using C at Codam. 
The following is a description of the program:
 </br>
>Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.
</br>


__The operations we were allowed to use:__ </br>
__sa__ : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
</br>
__sb__ : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
</br>
__ss__ : sa and sb at the same time.
</br>
__pa__ : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do
nothing if b is empty.
</br>
__pb__ : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do
nothing if a is empty.
</br>
__ra__ : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
</br>
__rb__ : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes
the last one.
</br>
__rr__ : ra and rb at the same time.
</br>
__rra__ : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
</br>
__rrb__ : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element
becomes the first one.
</br>
__rrr__ : rra and rrb at the same time.
</br>

__The program should be able to sort:__
* 3 integers in a maximum of 3 commands.
* 5 integers in a maximum of 12 commands. 
* 100 integers in a maximum of 700 commands. 
* 500 integers in a maximum of 5500 commands.

__My program had the following amount of commands on average:__
* 2 commands for 3 integers.
* 9 commands for 5 integers.
* 640 commands for 100 integers.
* 4950 commands for 500 integers.

**I enjoyed working on this project and liked to challenge to modify an algoritm to work using the limited operations.**
