# push_swap

Push Swap was the first project implementing algorithms using C at Codam. 
The following is a description of the program:

>Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting.

__The operations we were allowed to use:
sa : swap a - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. </br>
sb : swap b - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. </br>
ss : sa and sb at the same time.</br>
pa : push a - take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do</br>
nothing if b is empty.</br>
pb : push b - take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do</br>
nothing if a is empty.</br>
ra : rotate a - shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes</br>
the last one.</br>
rb : rotate b - shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes</br>
the last one.</br>
rr : ra and rb at the same time.</br>
rra : reverse rotate a - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element</br>
becomes the first one.</br>
rrb : reverse rotate b - shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element</br>
becomes the first one.</br>
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.</br>__
