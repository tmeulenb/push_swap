# push_swap

Push Swap was the first project implementing algorithms using C at Codam. 
The following is a description of the program:
Summary:
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an
optimized data sorting
